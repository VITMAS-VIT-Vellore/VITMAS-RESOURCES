To start with ML, you can either refer to countless resources available on YouTube, they are more than enough to get you a clear idea of what you are going to do on the software side. But to get an understanding of how the libraries and the code actually works, I would request you to take up your Statistics course in your 2nd semester. This book is really comprehensive and can give you a great understanding of what ML is all about.

Python knowledge is important and as you proceed you might want to learn more languages. So if you are weak at Python I would recommend a refresher course on Python before starting off with this.
